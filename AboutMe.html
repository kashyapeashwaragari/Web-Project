    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article>
    <p>I am Kashyap Eashwaragiri, aged 23, from Telangana, India.

        I have acquired my Bachelor’s degree in the field of IT from a college in Hyderabad, India and am currently pursuing Masters in Florida from Florida Institute of Technology. 
        
        During my first year of undergrad, I have also been a part of the college’s most reputed club, FusionTech which helped me broaden my skill set. </p>
    <p> I headed the operations department for the club and was responsible for it's smooth functioning. 
        
        As part of the club activities, I have attended various workshops, conclaves and conferences which gave me a lot of understanding about the practical applications of IT and helped me gain exemplary insights from Industry experts.
        
        Over the years and via my experience I have learnt to be outgoing and be efficient at professional communications. I have also balanced my college, part time job and social life which I believe portrays effective time management and multitasking capabilities.
    </p>
